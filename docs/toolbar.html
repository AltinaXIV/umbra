        <h1>Toolbar</h1>
        <p>
            Umbra's main feature is the customizable toolbar that allows you to host a variety of widgets to enhance
            your gameplay experience. The toolbar is divided into three columns, one for the left, center, and right
            side of the screen, each of which can host multiple widgets. Widgets can be added, removed, and rearranged
            to suit your preferences, allowing you to create a personalized interface that fits your unique playstyle.
        </p>

        <h2>Toolbar customization</h2>
        <p>
            The toolbar can be customized in a variety of ways to suit your preferences. You can change the size, scale,
            and position of the toolbar, as well as the opacity and background color. Additionally, you can choose to
            show or hide the toolbar based on certain conditions, such as when in combat or when the mouse is over the
            toolbar.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these options can be found under the <code>General Settings</code> tab in Umbra's settings window.
            Color profiles can be created, customized and shared by navigating to the <code>Appearance</code> tab.
            <br/><br/>
            Some of these options include, but are not limited to:
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Changing the toolbar position from bottom to the top of the screen.</li>
                <li>Stretching the toolbar to the screen edges, or having it "float" in the middle like a dock.</li>
                <li>Adjusting the margins around the toolbar, allowing you to tightly fit it within your custom UI setup.</li>
                <li>Automatically hiding the toolbar until the mouse cursor goes near it.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <a id="arrangement"></a>
        <h2>Widget arrangement</h2>
        <p>
            When opening the settings window, either by typing <code>/umbra</code> in the chat, or using the button in
            the system menu on your toolbar (if present), the first thing you'll see if the toolbar widgets tab. Here
            you can add, remove, and rearrange widgets to your liking.
            <img src="widget-arrangement.png" alt="Widget Arrangement" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
            Clicking on a widget tile will reveal a set of buttons that allow you to move the widget within the
            container, move it to a different container, or remove it entirely. You can open the settings window for
            each widget <i>instance</i> by clicking the 'cog' icon on the widget tile.
        </p>
        <h3>Widget Instances</h3>
        <p>
            Each added widget is a unique instance of that widget type. This means that you can have multiple instances
            of the same widget type with different settings. For example, you can have two different clocks with one
            showing the in-game time and the other showing the server time. Removing a widget instance will only remove
            that specific instance, not the widget type itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on the <code>+ Add widget</code> button that appears at the bottom of each column to add a new widget
            instance to that column. When clicking this button, a new window will appear with a list of available
            widgets for you to choose from.
        </p>
        <h3>Removing widget instances</h3>
        <p>
            Since removing a widget instance is destructive, since doing so will also remove any settings you've set for
            a particular instance, the delete button (trash icon) only works when you're holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd>
            key.
        </p>
        <a id="customization"></a>
        <h2>Widget customization</h2>
        <p>
            Each widget has its own set of customization options that can be accessed by clicking the 'cog' icon on the
            widget tile. Depending on the widget type, you can change the appearance, behavior, and other settings of
            the widget to suit your preferences. Some widgets may have more settings than others, depending on the
            complexity of the widget.
